#Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

#Overview

This project performs customer segmentation using the Mall Customers dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to cluster customers into different segments based on their spending behavior and demographic features using the K-Means clustering algorithm.

#Dataset

The dataset contains information about mall customers, including:

Customer ID

Gender

Age

Annual Income (k$)

Spending Score (1-100)

#Methodology

Data Preprocessing: Loaded and cleaned the dataset.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized customer distributions and relationships between variables.

Feature Selection: Selected relevant features for clustering.

K-Means Clustering:

Determined the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method.

Applied K-Means clustering.

Visualized the formed clusters.
